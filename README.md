# test-intellij-gradle-plugin
project with intellij's gradle ext plugin https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-idea-ext-plugin

* Open project in intellij
* Do a gradle refresh
* Do a project build

Note: The triggered task "copyTestFile" did not occur because you will not see ./test/test.txt

If this worked, that file would have been copied.
